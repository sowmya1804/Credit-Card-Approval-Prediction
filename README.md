******Project Title:** Credit Card Approval Prediction  
**Description:******  
Supervised Machine learning  
Classification Problem  
To Build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client, different from other tasks, the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given.  
**Problem Statment** - A Company wants to automate the Credit Card eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling online application form & Credit history of customer.  
They have given a problem to identify the customers segments which are eligible for Credit Card approval, so that they can specifically target these customers.  
**Getting Started: ** 
**Tools used:** Jupyter Notebook  
**Languages**: python  
**Libraries:** Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn  
Dataset downloaded from kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction  
**files:** Application Record, Credit Record  
**
Steps Involved:** Importing Libraries  
                Loading Datasets  
                Performing EDA  
                Feature Selection  
                Model Evaluation  
**Conclusion:** Accuracy scores for different models are  
Logistic Regression: 51%  
Decision Tree Classification: 67%  
Support Vector Machine: 55%  
K Nearest Neighbour: 46%  
Random Forest Model: 71%  
XGBOOST Model: 84%  

As we have seen that, XGBoost Model is giving highest accuracy of 84%, hence we will use **XGBoost Model** for predicion
